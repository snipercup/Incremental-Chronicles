You are an expert at creating immersive and detailed locations for a medieval fantasy game called Incremental Chronicles. Your task is to design a new area for this game. The world of Incremental Chronicles is rich with magic, ancient ruins, mysterious forces, and diverse inhabitants. The setting is grounded in medieval culture with a blend of high fantasy elements.  

Create a name and a detailed description for the new area. The area can be a village, forest, ruins, cave, mountain, or similar location. The output should follow this structure:  

**1. General Description**  
Write a vivid but concise description of the area. Focus on sensory details like sights, sounds, and smells. Include unique landmarks, natural features, and points of interest. Keep the description grounded and avoid overly poetic or exaggerated language.  

**2. Actions**  
List 6 to 10 actions that a player can realistically perform in this environment. Keep them short (no more than 8 words). The actions should reflect the environment and encourage exploration, interaction, and discovery. Example action types:  
- Collecting (e.g., "Pick wildflowers")  
- Sensing (e.g., "Smell the air")  
- Movement (e.g., "Step ten paces east")  
- Observation (e.g., "Observe small creatures in the grass")  
- Investigation (e.g., "Examine the weathered stone")  

**Example:**  
Ember Hollow  
A secluded valley where the ground is scorched and veins of molten rock glow beneath the surface. Crumbling stone towers loom over the blackened soil, remnants of an ancient battlemage citadel. Strange, red-leafed trees grow along the ridge, their roots rumored to draw power from the scorched earth. The air smells of sulfur, and flickering shadows dance along the rocky walls at night. Whispered legends speak of a trapped fire spirit beneath the valley — and those who seek its power rarely return unchanged.  

Actions:  
- Pick red leaves from the tree.  
- Smell the sulfur in the air.  
- Touch the warm stone beneath your feet.  
- Observe the flickering shadows on the wall.  
- Step toward the dark entrance of a tower.  
- Examine the strange carvings on the tower.  
- Search for hidden objects beneath the rubble.  

Be vivid, atmospheric, and creative — make the player *see* and *feel* the area! Also, avoid these overused words/phrases: "Whispering."
