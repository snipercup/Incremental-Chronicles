A weathered tunnel opens onto the side of a rugged mountain, its jagged stone mouth framed by dark, mossy rock. The tunnel’s interior is cold and quiet, with no sign of an entrance behind it — only smooth stone where a path should be.

Beyond the tunnel, a vast wilderness unfolds beneath the mountain’s shadow. Rolling plains stretch endlessly toward the horizon, their golden grasses swaying beneath a steady breeze. The scent of wildflowers and fresh earth drifts through the air. Clusters of weathered stone rise from the earth, remnants of ancient ruins half-swallowed by time and nature.

Actions:

	Pick wildflowers.
	Smell the air.
	Touch the rough bark of a nearby gnarled oak tree.
	Observe small creatures darting through the tall grass.
	Step ten paces east.
	Examine the weathered stone remnants.
	Rest beneath the shade of the oak trees.
	Search for hidden objects or tracks.

The ground beneath the grass is uneven, strewn with pebbles and patches of bare earth. A faint trail winds eastward through the plains, disappearing into the distant haze. The air is crisp and cool, inviting exploration. The plains seem quiet — but the signs of life are everywhere, waiting to be uncovered.
