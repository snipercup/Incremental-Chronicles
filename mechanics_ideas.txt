Here are three fully developed ideas that let the player make permanent investments using temporary resources during a run. These ideas are designed to preserve *Incremental Chronicles’* theme of growth through effort and reincarnation, while creating satisfying mid-run decision points:

---

### 1. **Seed of Restoration (Area Project Investment)**

**Concept**: In specific areas — such as the Village or Flooded Crossing — the player can contribute certain temporary resources (e.g. Turnips, Herbs, Iron Nails, etc.) to long-term restoration projects like rebuilding a structure, restoring a shrine, or sustaining a community.

**Mechanic**:

* During the run, the player invests a bundle of resources into a project (e.g. “Deliver 10 Turnips and 5 Herbs to the chapel’s winter stores.”).
* Once complete, the project is marked with a **permanent milestone** (e.g. `h_chapel_restored`).
* On future runs, the area shows a **visible change** (e.g. glowing lights in the chapel, stronger Resolve bonuses, new actions unlocked).
* These projects **require no special currency**, just careful resource management during a run.

**Why it Works**: It rewards sacrifice — giving up resources now to permanently improve part of the world. It’s immersive, fits the tone, and gives purpose to otherwise expendable items.

---

### 2. **Ember of Persistence (Convert into Legacy Resource)**

**Concept**: Introduce rare locations or actions during a run where a player can *burn* large quantities of temporary resources to produce a single **Ember of Persistence**, a permanent currency.

**Mechanic**:

* Found in secret shrines or through difficult paths, a player can perform a ritual: “Burn 250 Story Points or 10 Focus Crystals to create an Ember of Persistence.”
* Embers are stored in the Shifting Mirror and can be exchanged for powerful permanent traits (e.g. new Focus regeneration tiers, unique actions, or legacy gear slots).
* Optional: Track how many embers the player has forged across runs for hidden lore or Memory Codex entries.

**Why it Works**: It provides an end-of-run sink for excess resources and gives expert players long-term goals without disrupting early balance. The conversion process feels like a sacrifice and ties into the game’s spiritual tone.

---

### 3. **Oaths and Offerings (Area-Specific Legacy Paths)**

**Concept**: Certain factions, altars, or NPCs accept temporary resources as *offerings* in exchange for **hidden oaths** that permanently alter the story or future access.

**Mechanic**:

* A player may find an altar that asks for “25 Resolve and 5 Herbs” to make an offering.
* If paid, a **permanent flag** (e.g. `h_oath_to_the_grove`) is set.
* On future runs, this could unlock:

  * A unique story path
  * Modified enemy behavior
  * Access to a different reincarnation site
  * Lore from that faction in the Memory Codex

**Why it Works**: This makes temporary stat/resource choices matter narratively and mechanically. The oaths can represent alignment, sacrifice, or preparation for deeper truths.

Excellent — let’s design the **Codex UI** so it feels intuitive, thematic, and scalable across many reincarnations. Here's a full layout + categories, with descriptions and interaction patterns that match the tone and flow of *Incremental Chronicles*.

## 📂 **Codex Categories**

### 🌿 **Fragments** (Unlocked Memory Entries)

* Individual lore snippets from free or trait-based actions.
* Displayed in a scrollable list with unlock cycle + associated trait or area.
* **Sort Options:** By area, by trait rewarded, by unlock cycle, by tag

> 🔎 *Example:*
>
> * *“Aldric’s Journal”* → Hollow Grove → +1 Wisdom
> * *“Village Notice”* → Village → +1 Perception

---

### 🌌 **Visions** (Trait- or Focus-Gated Lore)

* Entries that **require Wisdom, Soul Resonance, or high Focus** when triggered.
* These give **expanded insights** or deeper truths about recurring themes.
* Visions may show extra story paths in later runs.

> 🧠 These are often **optional versions of normal Codex entries** with extended text.

---

### 🧩 **Lore Chains** (Grouped Narratives)

* Groups Codex entries that together tell a **mini-storyline** (e.g., the fate of Aldric).
* Completing a chain may reward an **Echo**, **Hidden Trait**, or **Vision**.
* Chains unlock a visual marker (glowing spiral, rune pattern, etc.)

> *e.g.*:
>
> * *Tunnel → Grove → Village → Temple*
> * *“The Forest Watches”* chain completed = unlocks “Instinct +1”

---

### 🔒 **Hidden** (Undiscovered or Obscured Memories)

* Shows silhouettes or “?” for Codex entries **you’ve nearly unlocked**.
* Hovering may hint at:

  * “Unlocked by high Perception in Tier 2”
  * “One action remains to complete this chain”

---

### ⭐ **Traits Gained**

* A visual summary of **permanent traits earned through memory**.
* Each trait icon (Memory, Wisdom, Echoes, Perception) links to the memories that granted it.
