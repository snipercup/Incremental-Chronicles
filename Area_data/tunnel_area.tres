"description": "A weathered tunnel opens onto the side of a rugged mountain, its jagged stone mouth framed by dark, mossy rock. The tunnel’s interior is cold and quiet, with no sign of an entrance behind it — only smooth stone where a path should be.

Beyond the tunnel, a vast wilderness unfolds beneath the mountain’s shadow. Rolling plains stretch endlessly toward the horizon, their golden grasses swaying beneath a steady breeze. The scent of wildflowers and fresh earth drifts through the air. Clusters of weathered stone rise from the earth, remnants of ancient ruins half-swallowed by time and nature.

The ground beneath the grass is uneven, strewn with pebbles and patches of bare earth. A faint trail winds eastward through the plains, disappearing into the distant haze. The air is crisp and cool, inviting exploration. The plains seem quiet — but the signs of life are everywhere, waiting to be uncovered.",
