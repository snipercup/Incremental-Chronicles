### **3. Core Gameplay**  
- What does the player **do**?  - The player clicks buttons in the interface. The player reads the levels of his stats and uses them to make the next decision.
- What are the **core mechanics**?
    - The player works to upgrade his base stats. There are permanent stats that persist after reincarnation. There are temporary stats that help the player in this iteration, but reset after reincarnation. 
    - The buttons will increase the player's temporary stats and lets him collect resources. Each button provides context and flavor, adding a basic story line for the player to follow. 
    - As the player progresses, actions become more and more difficult and will force the player to reincarnate after hitting the limit. The player will make it further into the game on the next reincarnation.
    - At reincarnation, some actions may be "bought" as permanent actions in the next reincarnation. This could guarantee certain stats (wisdom, perception ect.) in the next run. When this action has been completed enough times, the stat that it provides may be converted into a permanent stat and the action will disappear. This will save the player a click each time the action comes up.
    - An area will provide area story points. When a player lingers in this area and keeps completing actions, the area story points build up. When a threshold is exceeded, a story ending will present itself, letting the player choose to reincarnate after this ending for a special bonus, or continue exploring new areas.
    - There are two types of actions:
        - Free actions: They provide free story points and allow the player to explore the area
        - Locked actions: Can be done after collecting enough story points. These may unlock addition actions, npcs, resources or areas
- How does the player win or lose? - Getting further into the game and reaching higher tiers counts as winning. Reaching the limit on an interation will count as losing.
- **game loop** - The player starts with low permanent and temporary stats. The player progresses trough the story and tries to reach higher tiers. When the player hits the limit where an action or area becomes too much of a challenge, the player reincarnates. During reincarnation, the player uses collected resources to upgrade the permanent stats, increasing the chances of the next reincarnation.
- What exactly triggers reincarnation? - The player chooses to reincarnate by clicking a button in the menu. This decision is based on the current progression, collected resources and the scale of the difficulties before him.
- What carries over from each reincarnation
    - Base stats
    - Permanent resources
    - Unlocks
    - The player may spend some resource to have an area or action return in the next reincarnation.
    - Stats like wisdom or perception that were unlocked trough repeating an action multiple times.
- What resets after reincarnation?
    - Temporary stats and resources. 
    - All areas that are not "bought" before the next reincarnation are erased and the story is lost. All that remains is the tunnel that the player reincarnates from.
- What can be upgraded at reincarnation?
    - Story point cap
    - Make some actions or areas or NPCs return on next reincarnation
    - Convert repeated actions into permanent stat points (wisdom, perception, etc)
